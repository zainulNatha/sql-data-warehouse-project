Customer Report
================================================================================

Purpose:
    - This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors.

Highlights:
    1. Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
    2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.
    3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
       - total orders
       - total sales
       - total quantity purchased
       - total products
       - lifespan (in months)
    4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
       - recency (months since last order)
       - average order value
       - average monthly spend
